This was my last year’s summer reading. Probably summer is not the best season to read this book (maybe autumn/winter) cause saying it is sad I think it is a big underestimation; some parts are really tough to read through. I don’t feel like recommending this book to someone I don’t know very well because it could be triggering so be careful if you’re sensitive towards some topics. This book was the first that made me cry during the reading and in general, I don’t consider myself a sensitive person when reading books.
The book walks you through the life of a group of friends, with a particular eye on Jude who we can consider being the main character of the novel; every chapter is dedicated to a phase of life beginning from the university years until the later stages of life. If you wish to read an action-packed book with a fast pace do not try this novel: the action is quite low in relation to the dimension of the book. Instead, we can think of “A Little Life” as a profound psychological evolution of the characters.
The book is quite big (1094 pages), but the writing is awesome and realistic (brutally honest) which makes the reading less heavy. I particularly liked the Italian edition (Una vita come tante) made by Sellerio Editore.
