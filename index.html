<b>About me</b> Born and raised in Falzè di Piave (Veneto), during high school I discovered my passion for mathematics. In 2019 I decided to take the leap and enroll in the bachelor’s degree in Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. Here, I have taken part in NECSTCamp. In parallel with my studies, I have always been a very active person. I've been doing martial arts for over a decade and nearly six years of rugby in the local team; now I'm a gym enthusiast. I played the piano for eight years and played in a band for one year. During high school, I wrote some articles for the school paper, with this blog I hope to resume my writing hobby!
