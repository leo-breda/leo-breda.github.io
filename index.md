## Welcome

I am a PhD researcher in applied mathematics and machine learning, with a focus on physics-informed approaches for accelerating scientific simulations.

This website serves as a research blog and personal academic space, where I share updates on my work, notes on methods I find interesting, and occasional reflections on applied machine learning in scientific modeling.

## Research Interests

My research lies at the interface of mathematics, machine learning, and scientific computing. I am particularly interested in methods that incorporate physical structure and prior knowledge into data-driven models, enabling efficient and reliable simulations of complex systems.

Key topics include:
- Physics-informed machine learning  
- Surrogate modeling for differential equation systems  
- Efficient simulation and inference for scientific models  
- Applications to atmospheric chemistry and air-quality modeling

## Current Focus

A major application of my research is the development of machine-learning-based surrogates for chemical transport models used in air-quality studies. These models are computationally demanding, and accelerating them can enable new types of analyses with direct societal relevance, such as improved policy evaluation and environmental decision support.
