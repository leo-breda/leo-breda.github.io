What. A. Book. 
If you're not will to "lose" at least a month of your life this book is not for you. Despite its enormous size (the Italian version is much larger than the English one), the book is not a heavy reading at all: it is very smooth and extremely catchy. The story of 5 families is masterfully framed in the historical setting of the First World War giving the reader an adventure from which it is difficult to break away. I particularly appreciated the writer’s attention to historical details (it is described in the last pages of the book): this made the story extremely realistic, sometimes I almost forgot to be reading a novel and it seemed a real history book.
Quoting one of the reviews on the cover of the second volume (which I have already bought (• ε •) in the English version!): "the reader will probably wish there were a thousand more pages".
